            <p>
              b. The remainder of the Purchase Price, including any additional

            <p>
              c. Please note that a 3% processing surcharge is automatically

            similar tax applicable to the sale of the Goods will be paid by the
            Buyer, or alternatively, the Buyer will provide OCF with a tax
            exemption certificate acceptable to the applicable taxing
            authorities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            4. The Purchase Price is inclusive of sales tax, and is payable by
            the Buyer unless the Buyer provides OCF with a tax exemption
            certificate acceptable to the applicable taxing authorities, in
            which case the amount of sales tax will be subtracted from the
            Purchase Price payable by the Buyer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <li>
          <p>
            5. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the deposit is
            not refunded to the Buyer if this transaction is not completed. The
            Buyer will make payment for the Goods at the time when, and at the
            place where, the Goods are received by the Buyer or, in the
            alternative, when any document of title or registrable bill of sale,
            bearing any necessary endorsement, is tendered to the Buyer.
          </p>
        </li>

            address. The method of shipment will be within the discretion of the
            Buyer. However, OCF will only be responsible for the lesser of truck

        <h3>Risk of Loss </h3>
        <li>
          <p>
            7. The risk of loss from any casualty to the Goods, regardless of
            the cause, will be on OCF until the Goods have been received by the
            Buyer. The Buyer will provide, at its expense, insurance on the
            Goods ensuring OCF's and the Buyer's interest as they appear, until
            payment in full to OCF.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Warranties </h3>

          <p>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            9. OCF warrants that the Goods will be fit for the purpose for which

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            10. OCF warrants that the Goods are now free and at the time of
            delivery will be free from any security interest or other lien or
            encumbrance, except the security interest created in this Agreement
            until OCF is paid in full.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            11. OCF warrants that the Goods will be delivered free of the
            rightful claim of any person arising from patent or trademark

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            12. EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE WARRANTIES, NO OTHER WARRANTY (WHETHER
            EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY) IS MADE BY OCF REGARDING THE GOODS.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Title </h3>
        <li>
          <p>
            13. Title to the Goods will remain with OCF until delivery and
            actual receipt of the Goods by the Buyer or, in the alternative, OCF
            delivers a document of title or registrable Bill of Sale of the
            Goods, bearing any necessary endorsement, to the Buyer.
          </p>
        </li>

        </li>

          <p>
            15. Inspection will be made by the Buyer at the time and place of
            delivery or installation (if applicable).
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            16. Any refund will not include costs of delivery or

          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Claims </h3>
        <li>
          <p>
            17. The Buyer's failure to give notice of any claim within 10
            business days from the date of delivery will constitute an
            unqualified acceptance of the Goods and a waiver by the Buyer of all
            claims with respect to the Goods.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Excuse for Delay or Failure to Perform </h3>
        <li>
          <p>
            18. OCF will not be liable in any way for any delay, non-delivery or
            default in shipment due to labour disputes, transportation shortage,
            delays in receipt of material, priorities, fires, accidents and
            other causes beyond the control of OCF or its suppliers. If OCF, in
            its sole judgment, will be prevented directly or indirectly, on
            account of any cause beyond its control, from delivering the Goods
            at the time specified or within one month after the date of this
            Agreement, then OCF will have the right to terminate this Agreement
            by notice in writing to the Buyer, which notice will be accompanied
            by full refund of all sums paid by the Buyer pursuant to this
            Agreement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Remedies</h3>
        <li>
          <p>
            19. The Buyer's exclusive remedy and OCF's limit of liability for
            any and all losses or damages resulting from defective goods or from
            any other cause will be for the Purchase Price of the particular
            delivery with respect to which losses or damages are claimed, plus
            any transportation charges actually paid by the Buyer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Cancellation </h3>
        <li>
          <p>20. OCF reserves the right to cancel this Agreement:</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>b. in the event of the Buyer's insolvency or bankruptcy; or</p>

        <li>
          <p>
            22. Headings are inserted for convenience only and are not to be
            considered when interpreting this Agreement. Words in the singular
            mean and include the plural and vice versa. Words in the masculine
            mean and include the feminine and vice versa.

          <p>
            24. The Buyer may not assign its right or delegate its performance
            under this Agreement without the prior written consent of OCF, and
            any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be
            void. An assignment would change the duty imposed by this Agreement,
            would increase the burden or risk involved and would impair the
            chance of obtaining performance or payment.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            27. If any clause of this Agreement is held unconscionable by any
            court of competent jurisdiction, arbitration panel or other official
            finder of fact, the clause will be deleted from this Agreement and
            the balance of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>

            otherwise. The Buyer acknowledges that it has not relied upon any
            representations of OCF as to prospective performance of the Goods,
            but has relied upon its own inspection and investigation of the
            subject matter.
